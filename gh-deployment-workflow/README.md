# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates the use of GitHub Actions to automatically deploy changes made to the `index.html` file to GitHub Pages. 

## How it works
Any push to the `main` branch that modifies the `index.html` file will trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys the updated version of the file to GitHub Pages.
The website will be accessible at: https://niceProg.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/

## Setup
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for the `gh-pages` branch in the repository settings.
